These are simple JS projects to get practice. Uses express to serve files. Each folder is an individual project.
To use, ensure you run npm install before anything 
(install node.js if you haven't already). Then navigate to the folder of the project of your choice and run the command:
npm run start. The port it will run on is 3000, and can be accessed via
http://localhost:3000/

I also added some other stuff for fun in some of them to learn about API development with express.
